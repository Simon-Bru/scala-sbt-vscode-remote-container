# scala-sbt-vscode-remote-container
A remote container for working with Scala in Visual Studio Code without package installation/configuration headache

# Corporate proxy

To workaround corporate VPN; you must have some kind of proxy setup on your machine (ex: [Cntlm](https://github.com/versat/cntlm)).
That proxy must be running to run the development container.
